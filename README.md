# Hack Oregon Transportation Systems Backend Repository

This repo represents the work of the Transportation Systems project of Hack Oregon. We are a volunteer project for Open Data.

This repo is intended to be run in a docker environment.

## A note about line endings
As you probably know, text files on Linux (where we deploy and where our containers run) have by convention lines ending with `LF`. However, Windows, where some of us test and develop, uses the convention that lines in a text file end with a `CR` and a `LF`.

Git knows what we're using, and it tries to accomodate us by checking out working files with the line endings our platform uses. See this explainer from GitHub on how line endings work with Git: <https://help.github.com/articles/dealing-with-line-endings/>.

Now, throw in Docker and Docker Compose. Some Dockerfiles call for copying files from your host into the image during the build. If those files came from a Git repo, the default is that their line endings are your host native convention. But inside the image, which is a Linux filesystem, some files must use the Linux line ending convention or they won't work.

So far, we know that Bash and `sh` scripts will crash if they have Windows line endings, often with mysterious error messages. Also, Python scripts like Django's `manage.py`, when executed as commands, will crash mysteriously if they have Windows line endings.

One final note: `vim` has a command `:setfileformat`. Either `:setfileformat unix` if you want the Unix / Linux convention or `:setfileformat dos` if you want the DOS / Windows convention. Then save the file and edit your `.gitattributes` file to declare that the file must have that convention on checkout.

## Restarting Docker for Windows sometimes necessary
Sometimes, Docker for Windows loses contact with some critical resource and throws ugly messages like this:

```
ERROR: for transportationsystembackend_db_1  Cannot start service db: driver failed programming external connectivity on endpoint transportationsystembackend_db_1 (f944aeb0244747359af77373b4949561c6e6e1d8ee48fb0bfc8aba98aa32877e): Error starting userland proxy: mkdir /port/tcp:0.0.0.0:5439:tcp:172.18.0.2:5432: input/output error

ERROR: for db  Cannot start service db: driver failed programming external connectivity on endpoint transportationsystembackend_db_1 (f944aeb0244747359af77373b4949561c6e6e1d8ee48fb0bfc8aba98aa32877e): Error starting userland proxy: mkdir /port/tcp:0.0.0.0:5439:tcp:172.18.0.2:5432: input/output error
Encountered errors while bringing up the project.
```

If this happens, you will need to restart Docker. Open the `Settings` dialog and go to `Reset`. Select the `Restart` option (the top one). Wait till the green `Docker is running` light shows up and then go back to your terminal. Everything should then work. ***This is a known Docker for Windows bug, not something you did wrong.***

## Getting Started

In order to run this you will want to:

1. Clone this Repository

2. `cd` into it

3. The environment variables that Docker uses and inserts into the images it builds are taken from a file in the root of this repository called `.env`. Because it contains sensitive information like passwords, it is not checked into version control - you have to create it as follows:

    * Copy `env.sample` to `.env`: `cp env.sample .env`
    * Edit `.env` and change at least `POSTGRES_PASSWORD` and `DJANGO_SECRET_KEY`. You should not need to change any of the others during test and development.

4. Download the database `.backup` files from Google Drive and place them in `./Backups` *before doing the Docker build.* The build will copy them onto the image and the first "run" in a container will restore them. See [Automatic database restores](https://github.com/hackoregon/data-science-pet-containers/blob/master/README.md#automatic-database-restores) for the details on the restore mechanism.

5. The `.env` file and the `.backup` files have been added to the `.gitignore` file. Provided you do not rename them or change locations they will not be committed to the repo and this project will build and run.

6. Confirm you have executable perms on all the scripts in the `./bin` folder: `$ chmod +x ./bin/*.sh` Feel free to read each one and assign perms individually, cause it is your computer :stuck_out_tongue_winking_eye: and security is a real thing.

7. Run the `build.sh` script to build the project. Since you are going to be running it on the local machine you will want to run: `./bin/build.sh -l` - This command is doing a docker-compose build in the background. It is downloading the images needed for the project to your local machine.

8. Once this completes you will now want to start up the project. We will use the start.sh script for this, again using the `-l` flag to run locally:  `./bin/start.sh -l` The first time you run this you will see the database restores. You can ignore the error messages. You will also see the api container start up.

9. Once the first startup completes kill the container using cmd c/ctrl c depending on your os.

10. Restart the container using the same start command:  `./bin/start.sh -l` and both the db and the api will start up.

11. Open your browser and you will be able to access the Django Rest Framework browserable front end at `http://localhost:8000/api`, the Swagger API schema at `http://localhost:8000/schema`, and the Django `admin` login at `http://localhost:8000/admin`.

12. To Run Tests: run the `./bin/build-test.sh -l` command.

13. Note that the `api` container will write some files into your Git repository. They're in `.gitignore`, so they won't be checked into version control.
## Contributing
